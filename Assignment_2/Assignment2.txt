1.)     The branching factor is 4 and there are 8 spaces that are not blank, so the
        search space is 4^8 or 65536.

        Compare that to 40320 for the 8! search space of a standard
        sliding puzzle.

        Adding ROE adds 25216 new possible search states to the problem.

2.)     The state is represented by using a nested list to describe the rows and columns.
        Corresponding python file is slidingPuzzleSolver.py
        Please refer to the type hinting and code comments for more explanation.
        Please refer to times.txt for the average times to solve all 5 problems for each algorithm
        Please refer to A*_results.txt, BFS_results.txt, or IDDFS_results.txt for problems,
            run times per problem, and solutions per problem


3.)     Please refer to eightQueensSolver.py to see my solution for this problem.
        General description of strategy is to populate the board with 8 queens along the diagnal.
        After populated, swap only the column of every queen against every other to generate a list of possible moves
        Select the best of those possible moves as the next state.
        Choose next state to be current state if it is better or if the rare choice function chooses it.

        the rating of a board is calculated by seeing how many queens are in danger and HOW they are in danger.
        Each vulnerability by sharing columns, rows or diagnal between queens is counted and summed to create a rating.
