The chose state is just a list of lists of integers that should be length 3 at both levels. I decided to 
hard code a map of positions for each neighbor, I hate it, but it was quick and dirty and works... its not broke... so im not fixing it.

1.) As discussed, the search space for Three mens morris is far too large to fully expand and evaluate.
2.a) Alpha beta pruning does not solve the search space problem alone. I assume that the search tree is shorter, possibly by a exponential factor of 1/2, considering that the
  time complexity for AB pruning is SQRT(B^D) and for naieve minimax it is B^D.
2.b) Alpha beta pruning with heuristic sorting solves this nicely. 

I was not able to get a win when player 2 starts first. I cannot figure out why but it works well when player 1 starts. 
When player 2 starts, the game results in a draw... which after spending over 25 hours trying to get this work, is good enough for me.
